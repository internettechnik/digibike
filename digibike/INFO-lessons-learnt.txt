Naming
    variables: starting lowercase, then CamelCase
    methods: readable english method names
    classes: camel-case
    internal for getter/setter
        start with underscore _

Objective-C
    Object Orientation:
        we send "messages to objects"
    look out comparison of "Mutable" or not Mutable
        e.g.: NSMutableString, NSMutableArray
    NSArray always holds STRONG pointers to its objects
    we use "lazy instantiation"
        e.g. if (!_bikes) _bikes = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];

GUI
    always use storyboard nowadays
    
XCode Development / Objective-C Specific / History
    Always use ARC Automatic Reference Counting nowadays
    AppDelegate (former time kind of "for global variables" rarely used anymore

XCode - IDE Tipps:
    ALT for help on methods
    use REFACTOR/RENAME to change method names or so
    

NOT-SO-FINE / Ideas:
    Unit-Test-Output should be color-coded (red for problems, gray for NSLog, ...)
