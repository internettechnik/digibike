CHANGELOG:


2013-01-29 We invent an EBike :)
    create some structure for an app
        (/Sources/Classes/Application/Model,View,Controller)
        model-view-controller
    create class EBike (EBike.h and EBike.m)
        based on "base-class" NSObject
    test class EBike
        writing test-methods in digibikeTest.m


2013-01-29 
    Idea:
       a) watch: iTunesU, "Coding Together" from Stanford
             Developing Apps for iPhone and iPad (Winter 2013)
       b) join: "coding together" at piazza.com
            https://piazza.com/class#winter2013/codingtogetherios6
    ad a)
        watch from minutes 37: 
            add class "EBike"
                how does it behave? = "API" => create *.h
                internal implementation => create *.m
    also compare to existing demo-projects
        see: http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/

2013-01-28 minor changes to project-file
    => multiple developer work together via github
